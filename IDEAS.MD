### Formatting options:
This list contains more options than currently possible. Ideally only a subset of these should happen on a single 'simple' format. The scope may be too high right now - requires winnowing down.

* ensure capitalization after fullstops
* remove space at the beginning of the file (if found)
* no spaces before fullstops, commas, exclamation marks, question marks, colons, semi-colons, percentage symbols
* ensure one space after the aforementioned punctuation marks
    * no space after comma within numbers; eg. 5,100,020
    * no space after percentage symbol
* remove consecutive spaces after spaces
* make all characters other than the first letter lowercase
* capitalize all 'I's (first-person words - I, I'm) (perhaps as an option only)
* ensure ellipsis correction (if not properly used)
* when i.e. or etc. is found with incorrect usage, correct it
* ensure space before parentheses and after (if sentence does not end)
* remove isolated quote (not part of any pair) and/or perhaps report
* delete multiple empty lines (leave only one extra newline) if they exist
* report possible hyphen errors (and correct based on user choice)
* report '..' (could be '.' or '...') (and correct based on user choice)

### Other options:

* remove references (from eg. wikipedia)
    * more specifically, square brackets which contain numbers
    * delete extra space when removing ref in the beginning of a sentence
* add/remove oxford comma (not recommended unless user knows context)
* remove consecutive duplicate lines (or even non-consecutive)
* remove html tags
    * get only the text from html
    * get all links from html
